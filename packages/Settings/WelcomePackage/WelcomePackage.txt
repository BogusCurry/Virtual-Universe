This folder is the place where you can add WelcomePackage.iar files to load to populate your Welcome Package.
There are no inventory files by default.

This will download a few other modules as well, but all that is needed for this is the DefaultAssets/ folder. 
There will be a help file in there to help you set it up.

You can put multiple .iar files to load for the Welcome Package in the folder, however, 
be careful, as it can cause duplicate folders and items in your Welcome Package.

To empty / reset that Asset Library:   
On the console, use the command "Empty Welcome Package"  This will remove all the data and you will then have to reload the libraries.
The ViewerDefaultInventory.iar is required for viewers to have their sounds, default textures etc.   Other IAR's can be loaded in afterwards.
Remember to remove the IARS after they have been loaded, otherwise they may duplicate after every startup.
