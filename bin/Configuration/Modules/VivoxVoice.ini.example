[VivoxVoice]
    ; The VivoxVoice module will allow you to provide voice on your
    ; region(s). It uses the same voice technology as the LL grid and
    ; works with recent LL clients (we have tested 1.22.9.110075, so
    ; anything later ought to be fine as well).
    ;
    ; For this to work you need to obtain an admin account from Vivox
    ; that allows you to create voice accounts and region channels.
