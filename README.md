## About Virtual Universe

The Virtual Universe Software is an Virtual Universe derived project with heavy emphasis on supporting all users, increased technology focus, heavy emphasis on working with other developers, whether it be viewer based developers or server based developers, and a set of features around stability and simplified usability for users.

We arenâ€™t just releasing new features, but a new outlook on Virtual Universe Virtual World Technology Development for the average human.

Virtual Universe is an experimental and innovative framework containing advanced tools and options for creating virtual world applications.

Virtual Universe is not a virtual world, nor a stand-alone application, it is a scalable and customizable platform containing some basic modules, based on some fundamental innovative pillars (peer-to-peer architecture, secure communication infrastructure, legal framework, powerful scripting language); additional modules, extensions and expansion packs can be built on top of it on demand.

The core of Virtual Universe is the innovative Virtual Universe Engine based on a hybrid peer-to-peer infrastructure that allows the sharing of computational load in experiencing the virtual environment obtaining infrastructural resource optimization and bandwidth reduction.

It enhances the platform in terms of robustness, availability, scalability, load balancing.

and much more....
